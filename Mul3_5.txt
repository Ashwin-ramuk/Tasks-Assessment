Q:
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in.

    Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.


soln:
def solution(number)
  num3 = (number-1)/3
  num5 = (number-1)/5
  num15 = (number-1)/15
  (3+3*num3)*num3/2+(5+5*num5)*num5/2-(15+15*num15)*num15/2
end
